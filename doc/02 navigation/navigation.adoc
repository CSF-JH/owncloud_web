NOTE: You can identify folders by this icon: image:folder.png[folder,30]


To open a folder, just klick on its name:

image::all_files_ul_docs_hand.png[open folder]

Now you can see the content of this folder:

image::docs.png[content of folder]

Should you here also find folders, you can open them the same way...:

image::docs_ul_hand.png[open next folder]

...to inspect their content:

image::docs-examples.png[last folder]

Now you want to know where you are?

Above of the listed content you find the path of the folder you actually see:

image::docs-examples_mark_path.png[path]

Let us now have a closer look at the path-indicator:

image::path_indicator.png[path indicator]
